title: "Errors"
description: "How Benzinga API responds when errors occur."
---

Benzinga uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.
In general: Codes in the 2xx range indicate success.
Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter
was omitted, a charge failed, etc.).
Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with Benzinga's servers.

Some 4xx errors that could be handled programmatically include
an error code that briefly explains the error reported.

### Parameters

<ResponseField name="type" type="string">
    The type of error returned.

    One of <code>invalid_request_error</code>, <code>not_found_error</code>, <code>creation_error</code>,
    <code>update_error</code>, <code>deletion_error</code>, <code>forbidden_error</code>, or <code>authentication_error</code>.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="message" type="string">
    A human-readable message providing more details about the error.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="params" type="array">
    If the error is parameter-specific, this will contain a list of the parameters that were invalid.
</ResponseField>

## HTTP Status Code Summary

Bellow is a summary of the HTTP status codes that Benzinga API uses.

| HTTP Code          | Status | Description |
| ------------------ | ------ | ----------- |
| 200                | OK	| Everything worked as expected. |
| 400                | Bad Request | The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter. |
| 401                | Unauthorized | No valid API key provided. |
| 402                | Request Failed | The parameters were valid but the request failed. |
| 403                | Forbidden | The API key doesn't have permissions to perform the request. |
| 404                | Not Found | The requested resource doesn't exist. |
| 409                | Conflict | The request conflicts with another request (perhaps due to using the same idempotent key). |
| 429                | Too Many Requests | Too many requests hit the API too quickly. We recommend an exponential backoff of your requests. |
| 500, 502, 503, 504 | Server Errors | Something went wrong on Benzinga's end. (These are rare.) |

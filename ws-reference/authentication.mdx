To access the Benzinga API, you need to authenticate each request with an API token. You can generate and manage your API tokens from your [Benzinga Console](https://www.api.benzinga.com/token).

> **Important:** Your API token grants access to your Benzinga account, so handle it securely. Avoid sharing it in public repositories, client-side code, or other unsecured locations.

## Authenticating Requests

The Benzinga API uses **Bearer Authentication**, a secure scheme where each request includes a token in the `token` query param. This token serves as a bearer of access privileges to Benzinga resources.

### Example Request with Bearer Token

Include the token in the `Token` Query param of your request as follows:

```bash
Token: <token>

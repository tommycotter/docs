Welcome to the Benzinga WebSocket API documentation. This guide will help you get started with accessing Benzinga's real-time data streams, enabling you to subscribe to continuous updates on financial data, including live market quotes, trades, news, and other key insights.

## WebSocket Endpoint

All WebSocket connections can be established using the following endpoint:

```
wss://api.benzinga.com
```


## Authentication

The Benzinga WebSocket API requires bearer authentication. When initiating a WebSocket connection, include your API token in the connection URL as a query parameter in the following format:
you must include your API token in the `token` query param in the format `token: <token>`.

Refer to the [Authentication](./authentication) page for more information on obtaining and managing your API token.

## Subscribing to Streams

Once connected, you can subscribe to specific data streams based on your requirements, such as stock quotes, trade data, or news updates. Each subscription requires a unique identifier and specific parameters depending on the data type.

### Example Subscription Message

To subscribe to a live stock quote stream, send a JSON message formatted as follows:

```json
{
  "action": "subscribe",
  "symbol": "AAPL",
  "type": "quote"
}
```

## Rate Limiting

Please note that the Benzinga API has rate limits to prevent abuse and ensure service stability. Only 1 connection per API token is allowed at a time. If you exceed the rate limit, you will receive an error response.
